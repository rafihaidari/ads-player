        <h2>Yeah! Super cool blogpost!</h2>
        <p>In this blog post I am blogging about super cool stuff!</p>
        <p>
          Last week I was not feeling very cool. But then a cool friend told me
          about this super cool thing he is doing. First I was not sure how cool
          that is. But then I tried it out and right after I was extremely cool!
          Now I can totally recommend that, you should definitely try it out if
          you ever not feeling cool! But even when you are cool already, you can
          never be cool enough!
        </p>
